# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-using-Keras
Driver drowsiness detection is a car safety technology which helps prevent accidents caused by the driver getting drowsy. Various studies have suggested that around 20% of all road accidents are fatigue-related, up to 50% on certain roads.

Built a Driver Drowsiness Detection System using Keras, which comprises 167MB of an unstructured dataset consisting of more than 2800 face images from Kaggle, and got an accuracy rate of 94%.
